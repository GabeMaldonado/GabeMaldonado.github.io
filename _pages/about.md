	Hey -- welcome to my personal site.

    A bit about me:
    
    Education:
    AS in Natural Sciences and Mathematics with a concentration in Computer Science
    BA in Computer Science 
    Currently pursuing a MS in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence
    I've also completed certifications in Data Science, Machine Learning and in Artificial Intelligence for Medice.

    I am currently employed by Messer as a Performance System Analyst in the Data Performance team. Prior to that I used to remotely operate 
    Air Separation units and before that I was a Halogen Technician for the semiconductor industy and a Cylinder Control supervisor.

    I have a wide range of interests in the tech field and I have been focusing in ML and AI. 
    I like to blog from time to time mostly so I can reference the topics myself in case I forget but I've learned that some people find it helpful so that is a huge plus. Most of my work has been uploaded to my github profile and I hope to move some of the contents here in the near future.

    I also enjoy sports but have a big appreciation for footbal/soccer as I used to play myself and I also coached. I hold two coaching licenses from US Soccer but now I mostly cheer and support my children from the sidelines. 

    Thanks for visting!
