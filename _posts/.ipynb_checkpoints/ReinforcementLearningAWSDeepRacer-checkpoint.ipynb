    "# REINFORCEMENT LEARNING\n",
    "\n",
    "## AWS DeepRacer Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Reinforcement Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of Machine Learning in which an *agent* explores an *environment*  to learn how to perform desired tasks by taking actions with good outcomes and avoiding actions with bad outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "An RL model will learn from its experience and over time-- will be able to identify which actions lead to the best results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other types of Machine Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Supervised Learning -- example-driven learning, with labeled data of known outputs for given inputs, where a model is trained to predict outcomes from new inputs.\n",
    "*   Unsupervised Learning -- inference-based training, with unlabeled data without known outputs, where a model is trained to identify related structures or similar patterns within the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does AWS DeepRacer learn how to drive by itself?\n",
    "\n",
    "In RL the agent interacts with an environment with the objective to maximize its total reward. \n",
    "The agent takes an *action*  based on the environment *state* and the environment returns the reward and the next state. The agent learns from trial and error, initially taking random actions and over time identifying the actions that lead to long-term rewards. \n",
    "\n",
    "### AGENT\n",
    "The *agent* simulates the AWS DeepRacer vehicle in the simulation for the training. More especifically, it embodies the neural network that controls the vehicle, taking inputs and deciding actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ENVIRONMENT\n",
    "The *environment* contains a track that defines where the agent can go and what state it can be in. The agent explores the environment to collect data to train the underlying neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### STATE \n",
    "A *state* represents a snapshot of the environment the agent is in at a point in time. For AWS DeepRacer, a state is an image captured by the front-facing camera of the vehicle. \n",
    "\n",
    "### ACTION\n",
    "An *action* is a move made by the agent in the current state. For the AWS DeepRacer, an action represents a move at a particular speed and steering angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### REWARD\n",
    "A *reward* is the score given as feedback to the agent when it takes an action in a given state. In training the AWS DeepRacer model, the reward is returned by a *reward function*. In general, you decide or supply a reward function to specify what is desirable or undesirable action for the agent to take in a given state. \n",
    "\n",
    "## TRAINING AN RL MODEL\n",
    "Training is an iterative process. In a simulator, the agent explores the environment and builds up experience. The experiences collected are used to update the neural network periodically and the updated models are used to create more experiences. \n",
    "With AWS DeepRacer, we are training a vehicle to drive itslef. Let's explore this concept with a simplified example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Simplified Environment\n",
    "In this example, we want the vehicle to travel from point A to point B following the shortest path. Let's pretend we have a grid of squares and that each square represents an individual state and we will allow the vehicle to move up or down while facing the direction of the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scores\n",
    "We can assign a score to each square in the grid to decide wich behavior to incentivize. We can designate the squares on the edge of the track as 'stop states' which will tell the vehicle that it has gone off the track and failed. \n",
    "Since we want to incentivize the vehicle to learn to drive down the center of the track, we assign a high reward for the squares on the center line and a low reward elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An Episode\n",
    "In RL training, the vehicle will start by exploring the grid until it moves out of bounds or reaches its destination.\n",
    "As it drives around, the vehicle accumulates rewards from the scores we defined. This process is called an *episode*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iteration\n",
    "RL algorithms are trained by repeated optimization of cumulative rewards. \n",
    "The model will learn which action (and subsequent actions) will result in the highest cummulative reward on the way to the goal.\n",
    "Learning does not just happen on the first go, it takes some iteration. First, the agent needs to explore the environment and see where it can get the highests rewards, before it can exploit that knowledge. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploration\n",
    "As the agent gains more and more experience, it learns to stay on the central squares to get higher rewards.\n",
    "If we plot the results from each episode , we can see how the model performs and improves over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploitation and Convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "With more experience, the agent gets better and it is able to get to the destination reliably. Depending on the exploration-exploitation strategy, the vehicle may still have a small probability of taking random actions to explore the environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters of Reward Functions \n",
    "\n",
    "### Reward function parameter for AWS DeepRacer\n",
    "\n",
    "In AWS DeepRacer, the reward function is a Python function which is given certain parameters that describe the current state and returns a numeric reward value.\n",
    "The parameters passed to the reward function describe various aspects of the state of the vehicle, such as its position and orientation on the track, observed speed, stearing angle and more. \n",
    "We will explore some of these parameters and how they describe the vehicle as it drives around the track:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Position on the track\n",
    "*   Heading\n",
    "*   Waypoints\n",
    "*   Track width\n",
    "*   Distance from center line\n",
    "*   All wheels on track\n",
    "*   Speed\n",
    "*    Steering angle\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1- Position on the track\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters ```x``` and ```y``` describe the position of the vehicle in meters, measured from the lower-left corner of the environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2- Heading\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```heading``` parameter describes the orientation of the vehicle in degrees, measured counter-clockwise from the X-axis of the coordinate system. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3- Waypoints\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```waypoints``` parameter is an ordered list of milestones placed along the track center. \n",
    "Each waypoint in ```waypoints``` is a pair ```[x, y]``` of coordinates in meters, measured in the same coordinate system as the car's position. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4- Track Width\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```track_width``` parameter is the width of the track in meters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5- Distance from the center line\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```distance_from_center``` parameter measures the displacement of the vehicle from the center of the track.\n",
    "The ```is_left-of_center``` parameter is a boolean describing whether the vehicle is to the left of the center of the track. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 6- All wheels on track \n",
    "\n",
    "The ```all_wheel_on_track``` parameter is a boolean (true/false) which is true if all four wheels of the vehicle are inside the track borders and false if any wheel is outside the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7- Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```speed``` parameter measures the observed speed of the vehicle, measured in meters per second. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 8- Steering angle\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```steering_angle``` parameter measures the steering angle of the vehicle, measured in degrees. \n",
    "This value is negative if the vehicle is steering right and positive if the vehicle is steering left. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Reward Function\n",
    "\n",
    "### Putting all the pieces together\n",
    "\n",
    "With all these parameters, we can define a reward function to incentivize whatever driving behavior we like.\n",
    "The following are examples of reward functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1- Stay on Track\n",
    "\n",
    "With this function, we give a high reward for when the car stays on the track and penalize if the car deviates from the track boundaries.\n",
    "This examples uses the ```all_wheels-on_track```, ```distance_from_center``` and ```track_width``` parameters to determine whether the car is on the track and give a high reward if so. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2- Follow Center Line\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we measure how far the car is from the center of the track and give a higher reward if the car is close to the center line. \n",
    "This example uses ```track_width``` and ```distance_from_center``` parameters  and returns a decreasing reward the further the car is from the center of the track. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3- No Incentive\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative strategy is to give a constant reward on each step regardless of how the car is driving. \n",
    "This example does not use any of the input parameters -- instead it returns a constant reward of ```1.0``` at each step. \n",
    "The agent's only incentive is to sucessfully finish the track and it has no incentive to drive faster or follow any particular path though it may behave erratically. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "From there, it's a simple if/else statement that gives different, decreasing rewards based on the vehicle being within a given marker or not. If its outside all three markers, notice that the reward is almost zero.\n"

    "\n",
    "### The Reward Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In RL, the reward function is the primary code uded to incentivize optimal actions. It's a mechanism used by the environment to let the agent know how it's doing. The agent takes a particular action in a given state and receives either an immediate reward or a penalty. \n",
    "For AWS DeepRacer, the reward function is vital to optimizing the models and enhancing performance around the track. For instance, when using the AWS DeepRacer console to train a model with a supported framework, the reward function is the only application-specific piece and it depends on our input.\n",
    "AWS DeepRacer includes various parameters that will help you optimize your reinforcement learning algorith. \n",
    "See above for parameters and descriptions.\n",

    "\n",
    "A great reward fucntions can help us better optimize our RL model. In AWS DeepRacer, the reward function is written in Python code and it uses different input parameters to help encourage good behavior and disincentivize poor behavior. There is no single right answer for which parameters to include in our reward function and our best reward function will likely require a lot of experimentation. This experimentation can often be done more easily and quickly in simulation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A best practice for iterating on rewad functions is just to update one thing at the time-- for instance: adding one additional parameter into the basic reward function. The other reward function in the AWS console-- adds a parameter to avoid steering too much so they car can travel faster by following a straight line rather than zig-zagging across the track. "

    "## Tuning Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, we can set hyperparameters values prior to training our model. By changing these, we can make additional improvements to our model and get a faster racer. Also, remember that there is no one single best tunning of hyperparameters. We'll have to experiment and iterate to find the best values.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are eight (8) hyperparameters associated with the DeepRacer algorithm--all these hyperparameters can be tuned before training our model:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Batch Size -- defines how much of the data the model should work through before each new update. Typycally the batch size can be equal to or less than the entire size of the training data. For the AWS DeepRacer, batch size determines hows many images will be used for training. Batch size is a required hyperparameter and its value can be 32, 64, 128, 256, 512.\n",
    "2.   Number of Epochs -- determines how many times the algorithm will pass through the batch dataset before updating the training weights. In general, we want to increase the number of epochs until the validation accuracy is minimized. Large number of epochs is acceptable when the batch size is large. Number of epochs is not a required hyperparameter and its value can range from 3-10. \n",
    "3.   Learning Rate -- controls de speed at which the algorithm learns. It determines the times between the weights updates. Too large of a learning rate would prevent weights from reaching an optimal solution. A small learning rate might result in the algorithm taking longer to learn.  \n",
    "4.   Exploration -- gives a balance between exploitation and exploration. Exploitation is when the algorithm makes decision based on information it already has where as exploration is when the algorithm gathers additional information beyond what is already been collected. For instace -- exploration helps us find a high reward path that may not have been discovered before. Exploration can be categorical and epsilon. Categorical exploration has a discrete action space. Epsilon exploration has a continuous action space. Epsilon greedy -- will decrease the exploration value over time so that it explores a lot at first but later will perform actions more and more based on experience while still allowing for some random exploration.    \n",
    "5.   Entropy -- controls the degree of randomness of an action that an agent/vehicle might take in a given situation. The larger the entropy the more random actions the agent will take fro exploration. We can use these hyperparameter to have the modle explore new options instead of performing the same actions  over and over again with sub-optimal results. \n",
    "6.   Discount Factor -- helps the model decide the extent to which future rewards should contribute to the overall sum of expected rewards. With a smaller discount factor the agent will only consider immediate rewards. This is not a required hyperparameter and its range is 0-1 with a default value of 0.999.\n",
    "7.   Loss Type -- is an objective network function used to update the network weights. A good training algorithm should make incremental changes to the agent strategy so that it gradually transitions from taking random actions to taking strategic actions. There are two options for this hyperparameter: Huber Loss and Mean Squared Error Loss. The two behave similar for small updates but as the updates get larger Huber loss takes smaller increments compared to Mean Squared Error loss. Huber loss can be used when we have convergence problems whereas Mean Squared Error Loss can be used when we want the  model to train faster. \n",
    "8.   Episodes -- defines the number of tasks the algorithm will go through during training \n",
